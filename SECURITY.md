# Security Policy

We take security very seriously and try to patch each discovered security vulnerability as soon as possible. Also we use
[automated tools](https://dependabot.com/) to continually monitor vulnerable dependencies.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We use [full disclosure](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_(computer_security)>) for reporting vulnerabilities. Therefore please
submit vulnerability reports through our [issues section](https://github.com/coma123/Spring-Boot-Blog-REST-API/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=).
